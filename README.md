## Description
The user pokes (taps) a photo of Daniel and the number of pokes get displayed.

Different sounds are being played based on the number of pokes.

* For 10's, it's quack.
* For 100's, it's "Mandel" (Swedish for "almond")
* Else just a poke sound.

## Background
This is a little project that initially came about on the train on my way to our company's christmas party in Göteborg, Sweden in 2018.

Initially we got it to work on Android. The day after I got it to run on iPhone, as well.

## Features
* Apps for iOS, Android and Web (Blazor)
* Cloud-backend (ASP.NET Core)

## Special thanks
Thanks to my colleague [Joakim Janstad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joakimjanstad) for ideas and moral support.

## Futures (Version 2.0)
* Notify Daniel when he's getting poked at (Request by Daniel himself)
* Gamification - see who is leading the "poker league". :)
* More sounds. Random sounds.
